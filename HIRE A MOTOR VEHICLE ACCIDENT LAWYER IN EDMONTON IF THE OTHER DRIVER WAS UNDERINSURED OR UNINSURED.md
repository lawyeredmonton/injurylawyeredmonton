<h1>HIRE A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT LAWYER IN EDMONTON IF THE OTHER DRIVER WAS UNDERINSURED OR UNINSURED</h1>

Life following a motor vehicle accident can be quite difficult. It’s even more difficult if the driver who caused the motor vehicle accident was underinsured or uninsured. This is why it is important to have Underinsured Motorist Protection as part of your own insurance policy. This coverage enables you to seek compensation for your damages through your own insurance rather than the insurance company from the driver at fault in the accident. <a href="https://injury-lawyer-edmonton.com/personal-injury-law/car-accident">Click here</a> for more.

In many cases, it’s necessary to hire a motor vehicle accident lawyer in Edmonton in order to get the compensation you deserve. Immediately following a motor vehicle accident, you are required to obtain the insurance information from the other drivers barring any severe injuries that cause you to be unable to do so. You are also required to remain at the scene of the accident if you are medically able to do so until after you’ve spoken with a police officer. If you require immediate medical care, a police officer may contact you in the hospital when you are able to be of assistance.

A police report needs to be written up in order for the insurance companies to be able to see who caused the accident. Sometimes, the police officers can conclude who caused the accident based on eyewitnesses, skid marks on the roadway, and any traffic cameras that may be in the area. It’s important that you hire a motor vehicle accident lawyer in Edmonton as soon as possible. The first thing he will do is to examine the police report and compare it to his own findings about the accident. The best scenario for you is if the driver who caused the accident had full coverage and the coverage is enough to pay your damages. Unfortunately, this sometimes is not the case. Many times, the damages greatly exceed the amounts that the insurance policies will pay out. Sometimes, the insurance companies do not want to pay out as much as they should, and it takes a legal battle in court to get the compensation you deserve for damages you received.

<h2>What if the other motorist isn’t covered by an insurance policy?</h2>

If the other motorist does not have insurance, you will be responsible for the damages. If you have uninsured driver coverage, you will contact your insurance provider to make a claim, and they will cover your medical fees as well as any damage to your automobile that requires repair.The truth of the matter is that underinsured motorists will likely not be able to pay damages out of pocket. Most underinsured drivers do not carry the appropriate amounts on their insurance policies simply because they cannot afford to do so. A motor vehicle accident lawyer in Edmonton can help you navigate the various legal actions that are necessary when filing a claim against an underinsured motorist. If you were unfortunate enough to be involved in a motor vehicle accident caused by a driver who had no insurance at all, your motor vehicle <a href="https://g.page/sidhu-personal-injury-lawyers-ed"> accident lawyer in Edmonton</a> will have his work cut out for him.

Hopefully, you have <a href="https://www.fsco.gov.on.ca/en/auto/brochures/pages/brochure_autoins.aspx"> Uninsured Motorist Protection</a> as part of your insurance coverage. If you did not include this coverage to your own policy, you may need to file a lawsuit against the at-fault driver to seek compensation for your damages. It’s important to note that not having this additional protection was a risky choice you took when you obtained your motor vehicle insurance. If this is the scenario you are facing, be prepared for a lengthy battle, but keep in mind that even if you win the battle it doesn’t mean that you will receive compensation. If the defendant cannot pay your damages, then you may need your lawyer to help you in recovering the damages by other means, such as placing a lien against his property. Hopefully, you have taken the opportunity to include Underinsured and Uninsured Motorist Protection to your insurance policy so that you will not need to fight a lengthy court battle for your damages.
